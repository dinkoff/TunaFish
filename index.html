                     <h2 id="Introduction-Lore">Introduction Lore</h2>
                     <p>The Dragon clans have waged war for centuries, depleting the resources of the land as well as their own lifespan. Elders from the 4 tribes gathered in secret and decided to cast the forbidden spell "Grand Reset".</p>
                     <p>Preparations for the spell went well, but as we all know, all is fair in love and war: One of the elder dragons was a traitor, right before the spell was cast, he tried to ruin it. The forbidden spell half backfired.</p>
                     <p>Most of the Dragon population got reset from existence. Only a few remain and those few have their memory reset, but even without memory, it's obvious that they won't survive with so few in numbers.</p>
                     <p>But to start reproducing they would need to gather resources and build the Arcana Tower that would allow them to gather the precious Arcana needed to create their off-spring.</p>
                     <p>After the Arcana Tower is functioning they would need to also build a nursery for the newborn babies.</p>
                     <p><em>(The Introduction and lore are intentionally scarce, see The Story DAO for more information)</em></p>

                     <h3 id="Play-to-Enjoy">Play to Enjoy:</h3>
                     <p>Nowadays all games strive for the new trend of &ldquo;Play To Earn&rdquo;. But let's be honest, you'll only be earning while new players are coming in. As sad as it is, the current paradigm is akin to a pyramid scheme. Old players are earning the most while the last ones suffer losses.</p>
                     <p>That's only natural because currently, the games in crypto are not fun enough for people to want to spend money on them without expecting financial returns.<br />And it's hard to make a fun game when you have to balance a game with a real money economy.</p>
                     <p>That's why we will first build games that use our NFT assets and are fun and enjoyable.<br />We will also try to integrate with other crypto projects so that our NFTs are truly part of "the metaverse".</p>
                     <p>Only then, when the project is established and people want to be part of it, will transition to "Play to Earn"</p>
                     <h3 id="Iterative-approach">Iterative approach:&nbsp;</h3>
                     <p>A lot of games sell out their NFTs and then take years to produce a product, by which time some people have already lost their NFTs, interest or both.</p>
                     <p>We will strive to deliver small games and/or updates and listen to feedback so we can really create a community-driven game.</p>
                     <h2 id="Chapter-1" class="title">Chapter 1: Laying the Foundation</h2>
                     <p class="t_center"><strong>On launch we will aim to provide the following features</strong></p>
                     <h2 id="The-First-Game">The First Game:</h2>
                     <h3 id="Concept">Concept</h3>
                     <p>Our first game will be simple, but interacting with it will contribute towards global progress in unlocking breeding. (Note: The unlock would be manual as any type of contract interaction automation would require us to host the &ldquo;owner seed&rdquo; on a machine, and we&rsquo;d prefer to have it on a hardware wallet)</p>
                     <p>The idea is that the 4 clans have to rebuild after &ldquo;The Great Reset&rdquo; and for that, they need to gather resources and build the Arcana Tower and the Dragon Nursery.</p>
                     <p>Each of the 4 clans will allow for the faster gathering of a certain type of resource. <br />The resources being: Stone, Wood, Food, Crystals</p>

                     <ul class="default_list">
                        <li><strong>Primordials</strong>: +25% bonus to Crystals. -25% penalty to Stone</li>
                        <li><strong>Eternals</strong>: +25% bonus to Wood. -25% penalty to Food</li>

                     </ul>
                     <p>All dragons have 100% gathering power to their neighboring resources (not listed in the above bonus/penalty list)</p>
                     <p>All players will have to contribute to optimally unlock the next phase.</p>
                     <p>You have to own an NFT to start AND finish an action. So that people can't trade and multi-start actions.</p>
                     <h3 id="User-Interface">User Interface</h3>
                     <p>The UI will aim to be familiar to users and easy to use.</p>
                     <p>Below are <strong>ROUGH DRAFTS</strong> of the game UI expected at launch.</p>
                     <ul class="default_list">
                        <li>You can always see the global amount of collected resources.</li>
                        <li>You can travel to different gathering spots or the two buildings being built (to monitor progress)</li>
                        <li>You can see your currently selected dragon on the bottom left</li>
                        <li>You can see what the currently selected dragon is doing on the bottom right</li>
                        <li>You can Cancel/Finish an action of the currently selected dragon</li>
                        <li>You can select more dragons you own from the bottom center</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>There are 2 screen variations for each of the gathering locations.</p>
                     <p>If your currently selected dragon is idle, you will see the &ldquo;Harvest {resource}&rdquo; popup with options for duration and yield.</p>
                     <p><em>(All numbers are subject to change and balancing)&nbsp;</em></p>

                     <p>If your dragon is working, the popup will be gone allowing you to view more of the scenery.</p>
                     <p>The Arcane Tower and Dragon Nursery will never show popups, but instead, they will change as the % of resources gathered increases.</p>

                     <p>The goal would be to have <strong>both buildings</strong> up and running in around <strong>3 months</strong> if optimal conditions are met (Everyone works their dragons on cooldown on the right tasks).<br />Realistically we don&rsquo;t expect everyone to be participating and doing the optimal activities, so to regulate the duration we could use Events that reward speed-ups in different ways.</p>
                     <p>There would be several levels of gathering activities like in most gathering games:</p>
                     <ul class="default_list">
                        <li>Short Cooldown - Most resources per minute, least resources per completion.</li>
                        <li>Medium Cooldown - Medium resources per minute, medium resources per completion.</li>
                        <li>Long Cooldown - Low resources per minute, most resources per completion.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p><em>(Unlockable with events)</em> Extra-long Cooldown - Very low resources per minute, extra-large amount of resources per completion.</p>
                     <h3 id="Technicals">Technicals</h3>
                     <p>The game would be made in ThreeJS and use Web3 integration to allow for a browser-based game that connects with your MetaMask wallet to sync with your wallet&rsquo;s holdings.</p>
                     <p>It would use the standard &ldquo;Sign Message&rdquo; approach to prove ownership of an account and allow for credential-less login.</p>
                     <p>Due to the game being browser-based updates could be pushed dynamically at any time.</p>
                     <p>This would allow for easy updates to the game and adjustments to the numbers so that the game feels smooth.</p>
                     <p>Also, this would allow for the running of Events. Events could range from some simple tasks that could speed up the building process to mini-games testing different genres the future iterations could take.</p>
                     <h2 id="The-Story-DAO">The Story DAO</h2>
                     <h3 id="Concept">Concept</h3>
                     <p>We've all heard the legends about dragons. No matter which culture or where you live around the world you have probably heard a story about a dragon. Fierce giant creatures breathing fire and guarding treasures. Magical majestic beasts granting wishes. Proud and powerful beings guarding secrets that could change the world. </p>
                     <p>But our dragons are different! Having just suffered &ldquo;The Great Reset&rdquo; their story is yet untold. It is up to you as their owner to forge it to be a glorious one.</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>As a Ryu-sekai NFT owner, you get to be part of the "Story DAO". You and the other owners will vote on how our story will unfold, be it which characters partake in the story or what it's goal is.</li>
                        <li>After the story has concluded it will be made into a manhwa-style comic (See Solo Leveling/The Beginning After The End).</li>
                     </ol>
                     <h3 id="Technicals-2">Technicals</h3>
                     <p>We would hold the DAO in Discord (unless a vote is held to move to a specifically designated website)</p>
                     <p>Each holder would get a role via Colab.Land integration. Using that role he would have a vote on the future of the dragons.</p>
                     <p>We would start with just having 1 vote no matter how many NFTs you own, so as to make it fair and equal for everyone to lay out their ideas. (A vote can always be held to move to an amount-based voting model).</p>
                     <p>The story will develop in a two-week cycle.</p>
                     <p><strong>Week 1</strong>: We pick out the top 3 voted stories out of a general pool where everyone (NFT holder or not) can submit ideas.</p>
                     <p><strong>Week 2</strong>: The winners have time to do small refinements to the story and advocate why it should be the next step in our journey. Giving possible future developments or arguments on how it adds depth to the story.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the second week, the winner&rsquo;s story is added as a continuation to the official story and the cycle starts over.</p>

                     <p>We have <strong>10 000</strong> Genesis Dragons split into 4 clans. The clan trait which is the horns will be distributed evenly amongst the 10 000 NFTs, meaning 2500 of each horn style will exist.</p>
                     <p>All other traits would be distributed randomly with some having lower chances of occurring than others.</p>
                     <p>This section will be updated with more precise numbers as we near the release date.</p>

                     <h3 id="Tokenomics">Tokenomics</h3>
                     <p><strong>Arcana / $ARC</strong></p>
                     <p>The dragons will produce $ARC (Arcana). Each day 1 Genesis Dragon will produce 10 $ARC (Arcana)</p>
                     <p>1 $ARC = 1 $ARC</p>
                     <p>$ARC is the token utility within our metaverse. At this time ONLY Genesis Dragons will produce $ARC. $ARC is the currency which will be used in our ecosystem for many different things starting with breeding and then expanding into our future games. You will be able to earn $ARC from holding a Genesis Dragon inside of your wallet. Each day you will accumulate 10 $ARC which will be visible on our website from simply holding a Genesis dragon. Total Supply? Well, for breeding we will need 5 000 000 total.</p>
                     <p>A crucial piece of improving our ecosystem is our Genesis Dragons. Claiming your $ARC can be done at any time you choose <strong>after the Arcana Tower has been built</strong>.</p>
                     <h3 id="Breeding">Breeding</h3>
                     <p>As our Genesis Dragons earn $ARC you will be able to breed and make baby Dragons! To be able to breed you will need to own two Genesis Dragons and 250 $ARC and the Dragon Nursery needs to have been built. Then after earning 500 $ARC you will be able to make a baby Dragon! There will only ever be 20,000 baby Dragons ever created.</p>
                     <h3 id="Treasury-Wallet">Treasury Wallet</h3>
                     <p>For every sale on OpenSea and Looks Rare there will be a 5% royalty and of that, we will take 3% and put it in our Treasury wallet for future development and expansion of Dragonverse! These funds will go to our breeding expansion, game, and whatever the DAO votes on afterward! We&rsquo;re here with you for the long haul.</p>
                     <h3 id="Metadata-Hosting">Metadata Hosting</h3>
                     <p>We will be using <a title="IPFS" href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank">IPFS</a> to host the metadata and images for the project. The idea of IPFS is to be decentralized, so that once we upload to IPFS and the images/folder get&rsquo;s a unique CID (Content IDentifier) you can be sure we can never edit/tamper with it. The only way would be for us to change the entire URL in the smart contract, but that is VERY easily detectable. (That&rsquo;s also how we are going to do the reveal)</p>

                     <p>Our team is composed of highly skilled Senior Software Architects, and our Artist can bring your imagination into existence.</p>

                        <li>A Tamagotchi-like AR (Augmented Reality) game where you can take care of your baby dragon that you can view in your own house, or take out for a walk in the park.</li>

                     <p>Dragons are giant magnificent and proud creatures that can&rsquo;t be constrained. So our long-term vision of them is just that - No Constraints to a single game or functionality.</p>
                     <p>We want our dragons to be part of epic stories told through novels, comics, manhwa, videos, anime, cartoons, movies&hellip; maybe even a Marvel one?</p>
                     <p>We want you to interact with them in games, browser-based, triple-A desktop (and maybe even console games?) and in good time bring them to AR/VR/MR for you to be able to truly interact via touch and full immersion.</p>
                     <p>We want them to be part of the true &ldquo;Metaverse&rdquo;(see below) by not building our own secluded environment, but trying to be part of as many other projects as we possibly can.</p>
                     <p><em>&ldquo;A metaverse is a network of virtual worlds focused on social connection.
